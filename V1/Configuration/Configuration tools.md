# Configuration tools

## EdgeCmd utility

You can use the [EdgeCmd](xref:Installedgecmd) utility on both Linux and Windows to configure OSIsoft adapters.

## REST tools

The following tools are available to facilitate the execution of REST calls.

### curl

OSIsoft adapter documentation displays curl commands for configuration and management examples. curl is a command line tool supported on Windows and Linux that is used to make HTTP calls. curl has a large range of capabilities. You can accomplish any OSIsoft adapter administrative or programming task with curl. curl is also easily scripted, using Bash or PowerShell on either Linux or Windows. OSIsoft recommends this tool for managing OSIsoft adapters. Any system that can run OSIsoft adapters supports curl.

### Postman

Postman is an effective REST tool for systems with GUI components. OSIsoft adapters are supported on platforms that lack this capability. It is particularly useful for learning more about OSIsoft adapter REST APIs.

### C#, Python, Go

You can use any modern programming language to make REST calls to administer and write programs for OSIsoft adapters.

### System tools

Many OSIsoft customers use Windows computers, even though they may deploy Linux devices to host OSIsoft adapters. You can install OSIsoft adapters on Windows 10, and the same custom applications developed on Windows should work on Linux, as long as the application development environment is supported on Linux. OSIsoft adapters have been designed to use platform independent programming. To facilitate working with Linux devices, Windows tools like PuTTY and WinSCP are very useful for copying files and remotely accessing Linux command lines.

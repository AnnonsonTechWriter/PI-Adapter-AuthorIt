OSIsoft adapter documentation displays curl commands for configuration and management examples. curl is a command line tool supported on Windows and Linux that is used to make HTTP calls. curl has a large range of capabilities. You can accomplish any OSIsoft adapter administrative or programming task with curl. curl is also easily scripted, using Bash or PowerShell on either Linux or Windows.

# Health and Diagnostics

OSIsoft adapters produce various types of health data. You can use health data to ensure that your adapters are running properly and that data is flowing to the configured OMF endpoints. For more information on available health data, see [Adapter health](xref:AdapterHealth).

OSIsoft adapters also produce diagnostic data. You can use diagnostic data to find more information about a particular adapter instance. Diagnostic data lives alongside the health data and you can egress it using a Health Endpoint and setting EnableDiagnostics = true. For more information on available diagnostics data, see [Adapter diagnostics](xref:AdapterDiagnostics).

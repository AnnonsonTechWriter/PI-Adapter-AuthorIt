# Installation

Adapters are installed on a local machine using an install kit downloaded from the OSIsoft Customer Portal. For instructions on downloading and installing adapters, see [Install the adapter](xref:InstallTheAdapter1-4). 

Alternatively, you can build custom installers or containers for Linux. For more information, see the Docker instructions in the documentation of the respective adapter.
